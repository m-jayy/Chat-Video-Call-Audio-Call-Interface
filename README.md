# Mj-ChatRoom/VideoCall/AudioCall Interface


This is project is meant to ease the life of any developer looking to add chat/video call/audio call functionality into his/her Android application and would not like to worry so much about setting up the UI.

This Project is still in it's very early stages, but improvements would come over time.

** Note: This is merely a Interface, messages being actually sent and received by your application still needs to be implemented. **
